## Active Reminder

### App Description
This is an app to help users remember where they have kept important items.Given an item the user wants to remember, this app will require the user to enter the items location every time the phone is unlocked. The itemâ€™s previous locations can be viewed when opening the app.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: This sort of app can only work effectively on a mobile platform. Since people unlock and lock their phones all of the time, this reminder app works actively without the user having to open the application once it has been set up. 
- Story: The story for this app is very compelling. Since we all have such hectic lives and have so many things to think about, it is inevitable that we will forget something. Because of this phenomenon, peers would definitly be interested in seeing how well/useful the app would be for them.
- Market: This app can be used by anyone that uses a smartphone on a regular basis; there is a very large market. The potential is uncapped for this app. Everyone with a phone could be using this. We can narrow down the possible market to those that are forgetful, but there is no way we can objectively measure such a figure.
- Habit: The average user would only need to open the app once to input an item they want to remember. Once setup, the user would be interacting with the app everytime they unlock their phone. The average user would be only consuming the app.
- Scope: The app does not seem very difficult to implement at all. A list of items entered by the user and stored on the device would be used and a pop up would need to be made every time the phone unlocks for each item. A log would be made to store the previous entered locations of each item. It would be somewhat interesting to create. Our group has a clear idea of what the app will do.
